# CS API Example: FauxFace
FauxFace is a fake facial recognition plugin that simulates a workflow with asynchronous face detection of files.

It introduces two features in the CS Client: an enqueue option for files and a results view in the dashboard.

The enqueue file option can be accessed by right-clicking one or more files in a workspace and selecting FauxFace > Enqueue file(s) for identification.

To view the results view, click View Results under FauxFace in the Dashboard.
